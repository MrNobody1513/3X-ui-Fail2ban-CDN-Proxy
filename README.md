# 3X-ui-Fail2ban-CDN-Proxy
      This project is designed to manage concurrent user connections on a 3x-ui panel, specifically for scenarios where the inbound traffic is proxied through a CDN. In this setup, user requests reach the server via CDN IP addresses, rendering Fail2ban ineffective on its own for limiting individual users.
